# mousy
This is a 3D game project created with Unity using the C# language. 

The main character is a mouse who is trying to find the door that leads outside. Along the way, the mouse must complete tasks while escaping from zombies, striving to survive. The zombies are controlled by AI. If they see the mouse, they start to chase it until the mouse gets out of their line of sight.

Here are some photos from the game.
